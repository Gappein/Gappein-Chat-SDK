# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hard work) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

Ask for a review, your PRs won't be directly merged. 

Releasing a new version will be handled by the core developers of Gappein, we will try to incorporate your PRs as regularly as possible.
If you contribute regularly enough, please reach out to the core developers to add yourself to the core team.

Thank you!
